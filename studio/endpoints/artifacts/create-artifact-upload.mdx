title: 'Create Artifact'
api: 'POST https://studio.dubformer.ai/api/v1/artifacts/create'
description: 'Create a new artifact from an uploaded file or external source'
---

This endpoint creates an artifact record and initiates file processing. Use this endpoint after uploading a file via presigned URL, or directly with external URLs/S3 paths.

<Note>
  **Uploading a local file?** First get a presigned URL using [Get Presigned Upload URL](/studio/endpoints/artifacts/get-presigned-upload-url), upload your file, then use this endpoint with the S3 path.
</Note>

<Note>
  Can handle files up to 5GB.

<Card title="Observe your artifacts" icon="table-list" href="https://studio.dubformer.ai/artifacts">
  View and track all your artifacts and their processing status in real-time via the [Artifacts Dashboard](https://studio.dubformer.ai/artifacts).

## Processing Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Artifact">
    Send a POST request with one of the source parameters (`s3Path`, `url`, or `fragments`).

    The artifact is created with `created` status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Background Processing">
    The file is downloaded/copied/processed asynchronously.

    Status transitions to `upload_started` during processing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Completion">
    When processing completes:
    - Status becomes `upload_completed` (success) or `upload_failed` (error)
    - `size` and `duration` fields are populated
    - If failed, check `errorMessage` for details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Status">
    Use [Get Artifact](/studio/endpoints/artifacts/get-artifact) to check processing status:
    ```bash
    GET /api/v1/artifacts/{artifactId}
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Artifact processing happens asynchronously. The artifact is created immediately, but the file may not be ready for use until status is `upload_completed`. Always check the status before using the artifact.
</Warning>
