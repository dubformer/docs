title: 'Get Presigned Upload URL'
api: 'GET https://studio.dubformer.ai/api/v1/artifacts/create'
description: 'Get a temporary presigned URL to upload local files directly to S3'
---

This endpoint generates a presigned S3 URL that allows you to upload files directly to Dubformer's storage. This is the first step when uploading local files.

<Note>
  **Use this endpoint for local file uploads only.** If your file is already hosted on a URL or in S3, you can skip this step and go directly to [Create Artifact](/studio/endpoints/artifacts/create-artifact-upload).
</Note>

## Query Parameters

<ParamField query="fileName" type="string" required>
  Name of the file with extension (e.g., `video.mp4`, `audio.wav`, `script.txt`).

  This is the actual file name, not the artifact display name. The extension is used to determine the file type.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="s3Path" type="string">
  S3 path where the file will be stored. You'll need this path when creating the artifact in Step 2.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="presignedUploadUrl" type="string">
  Temporary presigned URL for uploading your file. Use this URL to upload via PUT request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expiresAt" type="string">
  ISO 8601 timestamp when the presigned URL expires. Typically 24 hours from generation.
</ResponseField>

## Example Request

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET \
  'https://studio.dubformer.ai/api/v1/artifacts/create?fileName=my-video.mp4' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://studio.dubformer.ai/api/v1/artifacts/create?fileName=my-video.mp4',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://studio.dubformer.ai/api/v1/artifacts/create',
    params={'fileName': 'my-video.mp4'},
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Response
{
  "s3Path": "s3://dubformer-artifacts/temp/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/my-video.mp4",
  "presignedUploadUrl": "https://storage.dubformer.ai/uploads/67a8f9b0c1d2e3f4g5h6i7j8/source_video.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=...",
  "expiresAt": "2026-02-04T12:30:00.000Z"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Next Step: Upload Your File

After receiving the presigned URL, upload your file using a PUT request:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X PUT \
  "PRESIGNED_UPLOAD_URL_FROM_RESPONSE" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
  --data-binary '@/path/to/your/my-video.mp4'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const file = document.getElementById('fileInput').files[0];

const uploadResponse = await fetch(presignedUploadUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: file,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'
  }
});

if (uploadResponse.ok) {
  console.log('File uploaded successfully');
}
```

```python Python
with open('/path/to/your/my-video.mp4', 'rb') as file:
    upload_response = requests.put(
        presigned_upload_url,
        data=file,
        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'}
    )

if upload_response.status_code == 200:
    print('File uploaded successfully')
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  The presigned URL expires after the time specified in `expiresAt` (typically 24 hours). Make sure to complete your upload before this time.
</Warning>

## Final Step: Create Artifact

After successfully uploading your file, create the artifact record using the `s3Path` from the response.
