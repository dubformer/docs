---

The Dubformer API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dubformer Studio Dashboard](https://studio.dubformer.ai/settings/api-keys).

All API requests must include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  Keep your API keys secure and do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or public forums.
</Note>

## Example Request

Here's an example request to list your projects:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.dubformer.ai/api/v1/projects \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Rate Limiting

The Dubformer API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Current limits are:

- 60 requests per minute per API key
- 1000 requests per day per API key

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response will include `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait before making another request.

## Error Responses

When authentication fails, you'll receive one of the following error responses:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Your API key is missing or invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: Your API key doesn't have permission to access the requested resource

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid API key provided",
  "status": 401
}
```
