The Emotion Transfer TTS API uses Bearer token authentication. All API requests must include an `Authorization` header with your API key.

## Getting Your API Key

1. [Sign up](https://app.dubformer.ai/signup) for a Dubformer account
2. Navigate to the [API section](https://app.dubformer.ai/docs/api) in your dashboard
3. Click "Create API key" to generate your token
4. Copy your API key and store it securely

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. Treat it like a password.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://app.dubformer.ai/api/v1/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Required Headers

Every API request must include:

- `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` - Your authentication token
- `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` - For POST requests with form-data body
