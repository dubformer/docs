### Projects
A project represents a single video dubbing task with specific source and target languages.

### Speakers
Each speaker in the video can be assigned different voices and styles (masculine/feminine).

### Mixing Modes
Control how the dubbed audio is mixed with the original video:
- `voiceover_only` - Only the dubbed voice
- `voiceover_with_original_track` - Dubbed voice + original audio
- `voiceover_without_original_voice` - Dubbed voice + background audio only

### Voice Types
- **Standard voices** - High-quality TTS voices
- **Soundalike voices** - AI-generated voices that match original speaker characteristics  
- **Emotional transfer** - Advanced soundalike with emotional expression
